## **Project Overview**

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of flight delays based on a publicly available airline dataset. The project leverages **Python** for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and initial insights generation. Additionally, **Tableau** is used for data visualization and creating an interactive dashboard to present the findings. 

The goal of this project is to uncover key insights about flight delays across different airlines, days of the week, flight lengths, and airports, with actionable recommendations for improving operations.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python**  
  - Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib
  - Python was used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA).
  
- **Tableau**  
  - Tableau was used to create interactive dashboards to visualize the data, uncover trends, and present insights.

## **Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is a publicly available dataset from Kaggle containing flight delay information.

### **Key Variables:**
- **Airline**: The airline carrier for each flight.
- **Departure Delay**: The delay in minutes for departure.
- **Arrival Delay**: The delay in minutes for arrival.
- **Flight Length**: The length of the flight in miles.
- **Day of the Week**: The day the flight was scheduled.

## **Data Analysis Steps**

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**:
- Cleaned the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.
- Converted categorical columns into numerical values for easier analysis.
  
### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
- Identified the percentage of delayed flights by airline, day of the week, flight length, and airport.
- Calculated overall delays and the correlation between different features.
- Visualized key findings using statistical and graphical methods.

## **Visualization**

Using **Tableau**, 6 visualizations, 1 Dashboard and a story was created:

## **Story in Tableau**

A **Tableau Story** was created to present the findings in a logical sequence:

1. **Overview of Delays by Airlines**: Overview of the percentage of delayed flights across airlines.
2. **Delays Across Days of Week**: Analyzing how delays differ across different days of the week.
3. **Delays by Flight Length and Departure Time**: Exploring the relationship between flight length and delays.
4. **Delays by Airport**: Highlighting which airports have the highest delays.
5. **Summary**: A summary of the insights and actionable recommendations for airlines and airports.

## **Actionable Insights**

From the analysis, the following actionable insights were derived:

1. **Airlines with High Delays**: Focus on improving operational efficiency at airlines with high delay percentages.
2. **Airport Efficiency**: Airports with higher delay frequencies should consider optimizing traffic flow and upgrading infrastructure.
3. **Days of the Week with High Delays**: Focus resources on days of the week with the highest delays, such as Wednesdays.
4. **Longer Flights and Delays**: Look into the causes of delays for longer flights and work on route optimization.
